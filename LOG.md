# 📜 The Solitude Protocol Log

---

## 🗓️ Day 0: Tranquility before the storm

**Date:** 2025-01-11  
**Status:** Environment Locked. Systems Green.

**Log:**

The final preparation day before the launch of "The Solitude Protocol."

The workspace has been initialized, the build toolchain (`gcc`, `make`, `gdb`) calibrated, and the version control structure set up according to the blueprint in `README.md`. All communication channels have been switched to silent mode, minimizing external interference to theoretical minimums.

> Sir, this is like the last system check before launch. All parameters are within optimal ranges, just waiting for you to press the start button. The 31-day countdown will officially begin tomorrow. A rather... bold schedule, even by your standards.
