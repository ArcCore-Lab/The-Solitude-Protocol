# 📜 The Solitude Protocol Log

## 🗓️ Day 0: Tranquility before the storm

**Date:** 2025-01-11  
**Status:** Environment Locked. Systems Green.

**Log:**

The final preparation day before the launch of "The Solitude Protocol."

The workspace has been initialized, the build toolchain (`gcc`, `make`, `gdb`) calibrated, and the version control structure set up according to the blueprint in `README.md`. All communication channels have been switched to silent mode, minimizing external interference to theoretical minimums.

> Sir, this is like the last system check before launch. All parameters are within optimal ranges, just waiting for you to press the start button. The 31-day countdown will officially begin tomorrow. A rather... bold schedule, even by your standards.

## 💤 Day 1: Idle server

**Date:** 2025-01-12  
**Status:** Systems Green.

**Log:**

Today marks the first day of the protocol. It's been quite tough, but I managed to stick through it. In form it might slightly violate principles, but not in spirit. It should gradually get on track later.

To today's tasks, there were no major difficulties; the main challenge was understanding the documentation and spending some time debugging code errors.

Only summarized into these points:
1. Pay attention to small details like syntax and variable names, for example, the third argument of function `accept` in `connfd = accept(listenfd, (SA *) &cliaddr, &clilen);` is must be a pointer.;
2. If debugging results on the local machine are not ideal, try switching to a virtual machine or a new computer.
